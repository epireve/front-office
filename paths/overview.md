  <script>
    export let clientName;
    export let proposalId;
    export let draftLink; // URL to Gmail drafts

    function generateSubject(client, id) {
      return `[Proposal] - ${client} - Proposal #${id}`;
    }

    function getGmailDraftsLink() {
      return 'https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#drafts';
    }
  </script>

  <div class="email-draft-notification">
    <p>Your draft email has been created successfully!</p>
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> {generateSubject(clientName, proposalId)}</p>
    <a href={getGmailDraftsLink()} target="_blank" class="btn">
      View Drafts in Gmail
    </a>
    <p>
      Please locate the draft with the subject above to review and send.
    </p>
  </div>

  <style>
    .email-draft-notification {
      padding: 1rem;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
      border-radius: 8px;
      background-color: #f9f9f9;
    }
    .btn {
      display: inline-block;
      padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
      margin-top: 0.5rem;
      background-color: #4285f4;
      color: white;
      text-decoration: none;
      border-radius: 4px;
    }
    .btn:hover {
      background-color: #357ae8;
    }
  </style>
  ```

### **Handling Feedback and Content Regeneration**

**Scenario:**  
After the proposal content is generated and injected into the Google Docs template, the BD team reviews the document. If they have feedback requiring AI-driven updates, the system should accommodate both automated content regeneration and manual corrections.

3. **Feedback Collection for AI-Driven Updates**
   - If BD users identify **major content changes** or require **additional customization**, they provide feedback through the web application.
   - **Feedback Interface:** A dedicated section in the dashboard where BD users can submit detailed feedback or specify sections needing regeneration.

4. **Triggering AI Regeneration**
   - **LangGraph Integration:** The feedback submission triggers a workflow in LangGraph to handle content regeneration.
   - **Process:**
     - **Identify Changes Needed:** Analyze feedback to determine required updates.
     - **Regenerate Content:** Use LangChain to generate updated sections based on the client profile and new requirements.
     - **Update Google Docs:** Replace relevant sections in the Google Docs template with the newly generated content.
     - **Version Control:** Optionally, create a new version of the document or track changes for transparency.

5. **Re-Review and Approval**
   - Notify the BD team that the proposal has been updated.
   - BD users review the regenerated content, make any further minor corrections if necessary, and approve the proposal for sending.

6. **Finalization and Email Drafting**
   - Proceed with **Phase 4: Email Drafting and Sending** as previously outlined.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Kickoff Meeting:** Align with your team on the project scope, timeline, and responsibilities.
2. **Prototype Development:** Start with a basic prototype focusing on one core functionality (e.g., interactive data collection and proposal generation) to validate the approach.
3. **Iterative Testing:** Continuously test each component with real user inputs, gathering feedback to refine and improve the system.
4. **Full-Scale Implementation:** Gradually build out all functionalities, ensuring each phase is thoroughly tested and validated before moving to the next.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the web application using Vercel or another suitable platform, ensuring scalability and performance.
6. **Training and Documentation:** Provide training sessions for the BD team to effectively use the new system and provide valuable feedback for iterative improvements.
